        "In *An Analytic Derivation of the Efficient Portfolio Frontier* (1972), [Robert C. Merton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Merton) described an algorithm to construct a portfolio with the <ins>smallest variance in expected returns for a given level of expected returns</ins> (efficient). The algorithm takes as input a list of candidate securities and their historical annual returns as decimal values, and it outputs the fraction of the portfolio to be allocated to each. Each of these output percentages may be positive or negative corresponding to long and short positions, or zero when no position should be taken, but they will sum to 100%. The example below generates an allocation strategy using the whole S&P 100."
